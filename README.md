# 🌿 Outside of work:
🍂 I love the outdoors, backpacking, and taking every chance I get to find my way back to the mountains. There's something incredibly humbling about standing at 12,000 ft and looking back on all the miles you had to cover to make it up. Somehow it makes every step feel like it mattered and every pound feel a little lighter. 


🚀 What Keeps Me Busy:
- 🛠️ Designing and building (troubleshooting) robotics projects to create something new and learn a new skill
- 🧠 Exploring the ever growing machine learning capabilities and their applications in engineering
- 🤝 Meeting other people with the same drive towards their passions, and hearing their stories of success
- 🎓 Mentoring others to find sucess, I may not know everything, but its incredibly satisfying to help a younger student achieve a goal
