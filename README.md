## üí´ About Me:

üëã Howdy! I'm Ian Wilhite, a mechanical engineering undergrad at Texas A&M, on an quest to uncover the wonders of mechanical design and robotics controls. My adventures have brought me to many incredible places, from research under some of the brightest minds I've met, to building pneumatic robots for 'life cycle trampoline testing' -- and yes I know exactly how funny that phrase is. I am incredibly passionate about projects where I have the opportunity to learn something new, and as I'm now discovering, there seems to be an abundance of those opportunities. If you like some of my work or just want to learn more, feel free to shoot me a message!

# üåø Outside of work:
üçÇ I love the outdoors, backpacking, and taking every chance I get to find my way back to the mountains. There's something incredibly humbling about standing at 12,000 ft and looking back on all the miles you had to cover to make it up. Somehow it makes every step feel like it mattered and every pound feel a little lighter.

üöÄ What Keeps Me Busy:
- üõ†Ô∏è Designing and building (troubleshooting) robotics projects to create something new and learn a new skill
- üß† Exploring the ever growing machine learning capabilities and their applications in engineering
- ü§ù Meeting other people with the same drive towards their passions, and hearing their stories of success
- üéì Mentoring others to find sucess, I may not know everything, but its incredibly satisfying to help a younger student achieve a goal
